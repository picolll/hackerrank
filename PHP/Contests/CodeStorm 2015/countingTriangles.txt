Problem Statement

Ilia has N sticks. The size of the ith stick is Ai.
He wants to know the number of different types of triangles created with each side from a single different stick.
Help Ilia calculate the number of acute triangles, right triangles and obtuse triangles.

Input Format

The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers. The ith number denotes Ai.

Constraints

For 40% score: 3≤N≤500
For all testcases:
1≤A[i]≤104
A[i]<A[i+1] where 1≤i<N

Output Format

Print 3 integers: the number of acute triangles, right triangles and obtuse triangles, respectively.
