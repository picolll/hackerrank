Problem Statement

The Head Librarian at a library wants you to make a program that calculates the fine for returning the book after the return date.
You are given the actual and the expected return dates. Calculate the fine as follows:

    If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged, in other words fine is 0.
    If the book is returned in the same calendar month as the expected return date, Fine = 15 Hackos × Number of late days
    If the book is not returned in the same calendar month but in the same calendar year as the expected return date, Fine = 500 Hackos × Number of late months
    If the book is not returned in the same calendar year, the fine is fixed at 10000 Hackos.

Input
You are given the actual and the expected return dates in D M Y format in two separate lines.
The first line contains the D M Y values for the actual return date and the next line contains the D M Y values for the expected return date.
Here's a sample:

9 6 2015
6 6 2015

Constraints:
1≤D≤31
1≤M≤12
1≤Y≤3000
Given date is a valid date on a Gregorian calendar.

Output
Print a single value representing the fine.
The sample output for the above input would be 45.
(Since the actual date is 3 days later than expected, the fine is calculated as 15×3=45 Hackos.)
